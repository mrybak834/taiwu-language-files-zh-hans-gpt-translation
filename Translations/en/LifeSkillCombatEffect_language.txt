Re-discuss
You can place the opposing argument with low evidence horizontally, vertically, or diagonally
Direct expression
You can place the questions on your own arguments in any horizontal or vertical position (but you cannot cross over the opponent's higher arguments）
Break free
You can place the questions diagonally on your own points (you cannot cross over the opponent's points that are higher in argument）
Elaboration
The argument on our side can increase the argument value of all our placed pieces in horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines
Chain
Increase the value of the argument for this move when answering or countering the other party's questions
Implement
Our side's argument can increase the argument value of all our pieces placed on any horizontal or vertical grid (blocked by the opponent's argument）
Checks and balances
If the other party chooses to answer their own questions or counter-questions, it reduces the evidential value of their response
Indirectly hinting
Our arguments can reduce the opponent's evidence for placing pieces in all horizontal, vertical, and diagonal directions by one space
Side attack
Our argument can reduce all the opponent's moves in any horizontal and vertical square
Intimidation
When our side's questions and counterquestions transform into our own arguments, we eliminate the low-lying opposing arguments in the horizontal, vertical, and diagonal grid
Slander
It can be used on one's own argument to specify the elimination of an opposing argument that is lower than one's own argument in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal position
Reprimand
When our side's questions and counter-questions are turned into our own arguments, eliminate the opposing arguments with arbitrary low ground in both horizontal and vertical formats (do not cross over the opposing arguments with high ground）
Foreshadowing
When answering questions or responding to counter-questions from our side, the other party's books used for answers are subjected to an additional round of cooldown
exaggerate
When our side asks or retorts, show 3 more books to enter cooldown
Partially ajar
When asking or counter-questioning, show fewer than 3 books entering cooldown
Insight
It can be used against arguments where the other party has employed strategies, directly eliminating the effects of all strategies in this square
Misinterpretation
When our side's questions and counter-questions transform into our own arguments, the strategy effect of eliminating all opposing viewpoints in the same horizontal, vertical, or diagonal grid
Understanding
When your side's questioning or counter-questioning transforms into your argument, eliminate the strategic effects of all opposing arguments in any format
Deep thought
Randomly reduce the cooldown of three of your own books that are currently on cooldown by one turn after use
infuriate
After use, randomly increase the opponent's cooldown by three turns for books
Inspiration
You can designate a book of your own that is currently cooling down to fully restore its cooling
Citing extensively
When the party's questions and counter-questions are transformed into their own arguments, a strategy for extracting based on the number of arguments in the horizontal, vertical, and diagonal grids is applied
Side reference
It can be used on one's own argument, extracting an equivalent number of strategies based on this score
Direct引用
When the opposing party's questions and counterquestions transform into our own arguments, adopt a strategy for extracting our argument quantity based on horizontal or vertical criteria (obstructed by the opposing party's arguments）
Re-discussion
You can place a piece on your own argument, retrieve all your strategies related to this argument, and replace this argument with the current placement state
Conclusion
The book used for our placement this time will not increase the cooldown rounds
Strong Argument
One can directly translate the opponent's argument, which has low supporting evidence, into one's own argument
