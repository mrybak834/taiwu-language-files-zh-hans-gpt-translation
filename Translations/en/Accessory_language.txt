Although the book does not contain incantations or symbols, if one quietly recites selected stories from the book to the Goo insects, the insects may respond differently: some may be energetic, some may act sluggishly, some may roll over, and some may remain curled up and motionless. Perhaps, as the opening of the book states: 'Goo is the spirit of the heart, the ghost of emotions,' could it be that the Goo insects are deities that feed on the poison of human hearts？

Without fear, it is difficult to seek wisdom。

It is a treasure passed down by the master of Guigu on his deathbed to his three esteemed disciples. The three disciples, unwilling to accept the death of their master, used this seal to forge a realm in the clouds, continuously seizing the energy of heaven, earth, and people to prolong the life of their master, hoping to find a way out amidst the calamity of heaven and the destruction of humanity, and expecting their master to be reborn to support the people. However, over the course of a thousand years, the fairyland has drifted further away from the common folk, until it becomes irretrievable……
