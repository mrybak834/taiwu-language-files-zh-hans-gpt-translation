The Goddess Returns the Sword

The Mo Girl, also known as the Bird Spirit Doctor, is the daughter of the Heavenly Emperor. At that time, there was a great mountain south of the Yangtze River, called Bushi Mountain. In this mountain, there were birds that did not chirp, and the Mo Girl lived alone in this mountain. The birds would see her and fly down to her shoulders to cry. The Mo Girl knew that these birds often drank from a certain pool of water in the mountain, and drinking too much caused them to lose their ability to sing. So, the Mo Girl found that pool of water and discovered a slender person who had been collecting a kind of tricolor spirit iron—cicada shells—by the pool for many years to forge swords. This person told the Mo Girl: 'Under this pool of water, there is a demon that often eats cicada shells for cultivation and has cast a wicked spell in the water so that those who harm it cannot enter the deep part of the pool. I forge swords here to eliminate it.' The Mo Girl listened to him but did not believe, so she threw the sword he forged into the pool and drove him away. Then, she used some wonderful herbs to heal the birds in the mountain, allowing them all to regain their ability to sing. However, later, just as the sword-forger had said, there truly was a demon beneath that pool, and within a month of the sword-forger's departure, it emerged from the deep pool, causing disaster in the mountain. The Mo Girl regretted it greatly and disregarded the evil of the demon, sacrificing herself to enter the pool, enduring the piercing cold and the pain of the demon's essence eroding her body. She finally retrieved the sword she had discarded, wrapped it in her clothes, and had the birds in the mountain carry it away and return it to the sword-forger, asking him to come and slay the demon. However, not long after, the Mo Girl died from the poison of the pool water. Later, the sword-forger used this spiritual sword to eliminate the demon. Touched by the Mo Girl's sacrifice to return the sword, he named it Mo Girl's Garment, and it is said that the spiritual energy of Mo Girl's Garment can解 hundred thousand poisons. After that, the Mo Girl's body lay on Bushi Mountain, never to decay。


Subduing Evil in the Town Prison

In ancient times, there was a divine being in the western realm named Dayue Yaochang. Dayue Yaochang's 'father' was Qinhua, who was the 'son' of Dayu. Dayue Yaochang lived for only seven hundred years in this world: In the first hundred years, Dayue Yaochang defeated many demon dragons and evil serpents in the southern Heishui; in the next two hundred years, he slayed many fiery drought spirits under the western Huangchuan; in another hundred years, he exterminated countless frost monsters and snow spirits in the bitter cold land to the north; in another hundred years, he traveled to the eastern sea and sky realm to subdue thousands of earth spirits and ghosts; in the final two hundred years, Dayue Yaochang simply waited under Kunlun Mountain for ascension. After his ascension, he left behind his remains, and all the妖魔鬼怪 (demons and monsters) in the world dared not harm his remains. These bones, worn by the passage of time, eventually coalesced into the Trapped Prison Suppressing Evil Stone。


Strange cold spiritual energy

At the beginning of the primordial chaos, the Flame Emperor and the girl from Chishui intertwined with each other, producing Yan Ju. Yan Ju later gave birth to Jie Bing, and Jie Bing then gave birth to Xi Qi, who in turn gave birth to Zhu Rong, and Zhu Rong begot Gong Gong.  \nGong Gong is the god of water, with a snake body and a human face, his hair is fire red. He fought against the Yellow Emperor, intending to seize the throne, but he could never achieve victory.  \nFilled with rage, Gong Gong furiously crashed into the mountain of Bu Zhou.  \nThe mountain of Bu Zhou is the pillar of heaven, and Gong Gong's anger caused it to break. The sky then tilted to the northwest, and the earth collapsed to the southeast, causing the stars to begin moving from the southeast to the northwest, while the rivers and waters within the divine land rushed uncontrollably from the northwest to the southeast.  \nAt that time, in the southeastern region, there was a valley called Hou Ze. In Hou Ze lived the Horned People.  \nThe Horned People were not much different from ordinary people, numbering in the tens of thousands, yet they never ventured outside of Hou Ze. Among the Horned People was a man named Jiu Han, who was born able to drive away the chilly air, but he could not control it. He froze to death after his parents perished at his birth. Thus, the Horned People cast him to a snow mountain on the western side of Hou Ze, forbidding him to interact with people or animals, let alone enter Hou Ze.  \nLater, Jiu Han married the Snow Woman from the snow mountain. After winter, the Snow Woman, who had a short lifespan, turned into snow water, leaving Jiu Han heartbroken. He often took water and froze it into ice.  \nAfter Gong Gong crashed into the mountain of Bu Zhou, rivers flowed to the southeast, and Hou Ze experienced a great flood. Unable to bear the suffering of the Horned People, Jiu Han used his own power to freeze the millions of acres of surging floodwaters into ice and snow, transforming it into an ice mountain that reached into the clouds, while he himself was buried deep beneath the ice mountain. Since then, the Horned People commemorated Jiu Han by naming that ice mountain Mount Jiu Han. It is said that after Jiu Han died, there would often be songs of sorrow sung by the Snow Woman in Mount Jiu Han, and the ice and snow on Mount Jiu Han could not be melted even by the sun's true fire。


Seven writings and five colors

The phoenix is divided into males and females, with males called Feng and females called Huang. When the Heavenly Emperor was in power, he once asked the Heavenly Elder: What is a phoenix? The Heavenly Elder answered: The phoenix is a divine bird, with a head like a big goose, a body like a Qilin, a neck like a snake's neck, a tail like a fish's tail, a chin like that of a swallow, and a beak like a chicken's. Its body is adorned with colorful patterns. The patterns on its head symbolize 'virtue,' those on its belly symbolize 'trust,' those on its back symbolize 'courtesy,' those on its chest symbolize 'benevolence,' those on its wings symbolize 'righteousness,' its feet tread upon 'justice,' and its tail is tied to 'military power.' When it sings, the sound is like striking gold and shaking jade, and when it roars, it is like beating drums that startle the heavens. When it stretches its neck and spreads its wings, it is a dazzling display of colors. Legend has it that the phoenix is immortal, but each of its life cycles lasts only four thousand six hundred days. Countless red-eyed golden silkworms grow on the phoenix. Every four thousand six hundred days, the red-eyed golden silkworms swallow silk to bind the phoenix in a cocoon. After another four thousand six hundred days, the cocoon breaks, and the phoenix emerges, gaining rebirth。


Unparalleled beauty that can topple kingdoms

The Kingdom of Qingqiu lies to the north of the Valley of Chaoyang, which is the residence of the Water Lord Tian Wu. The people living in the Kingdom of Qingqiu all wear silk and brocade for clothing and eat raw grains, as the people of Qingqiu are not good at using fire; thus, all the fire seeds in the Kingdom of Qingqiu have extinguished.  \nThe king of Qingqiu is named Shufang, whose father is a locust tree. He is a vassal of Tian Wu. Shufang has seventeen daughters, all of whom eventually marry the Water Lord, except for the youngest, Yiyi Hou, who stays by Shufang's side.  \nBecause Yiyi Hou's beauty is too enchanting, the local nobleman, Daozi Fu, performed divination for her, with the fortune saying: "Her beauty, oh her beauty, the heavens may collapse and the earth overturn; the four seasons will cease their cycles; countless warriors will take up arms, and mountains and rivers will be stained red with blood; there will be many calamities from heaven to earth; this is a great misfortune." (Her beauty, that even heaven would collapse and earth would turn over, seeks to fall into her embrace; the four seasons no longer rotate because of her; countless nations ignite in warfare because of her, staining the mountains and rivers with blood; henceforth, many disasters will befall from heaven and earth, indicating great doom.)  \nUpon hearing this divination, Shufang was terrified and, with a heavy heart, commanded that Yiyi Hou's beauty be marred. However, when Yiyi Hou’s injuries healed, her beauty returned once more. After three attempts, each time resulting the same, Shufang was at a loss and instructed Yiyi Hou to dress in men’s clothing from a young age, thinking this would avert disaster. Later, when Yiyi Hou grew to nineteen years of age, her beauty could no longer be hidden, so Shufang sent her outside the Kingdom of Qingqiu to accompany the nine-tailed fox.  \nAmong the nine-tailed foxes, there was a young spirit fox with only seven tails, thus being called the "ugly fox" by the other nine-tailed foxes. It taught Yiyi Hou to capture the fire of the Four Symbols using blood.  \nYiyi Hou fell in love with it and married it, becoming its wife. From then on, people realized that Yiyi Hou was indeed a woman. Her beauty soon spread to surrounding countries, and people would be enchanted upon hearing the name Yiyi Hou. The Water Lord Tian Wu also came to wed Yiyi Hou. Shufang, fearing Tian Wu's divine powers, summoned Daozi Fu to fetch Yiyi Hou back.  \nDaozi Fu found Yiyi Hou washing clothes alone by the river and said to her, "Your husband has become an immortal and has gone to heaven." Yiyi Hou rushed home, only to find her house filled with mesmerizing clouds and mist, and could not find the ugly fox anywhere. This was because Daozi Fu had already lured the ugly fox to the Burning God Mountain, where he killed it with a large nail made of peach wood.  \nYiyi Hou was heartbroken and dispirited, and thus returned to the Kingdom of Qingqiu with Daozi Fu.  \nOn the day of her wedding, the processional from Tian Wu passed by the foot of Burning God Mountain with Yiyi Hou. Suddenly, towering flames erupted from the mountain, the fire’s intensity beyond imagination, burning up to the Ninth Heaven. Yiyi Hou wept profusely, knowing that the ugly fox was on Burning God Mountain, and ran into the mountain. Shufang and Daozi Fu tried to follow but were turned to ashes by the flames. Later, the fire on Burning God Mountain slowly extinguished, yet not a single blade of grass nor wood was burned。


Dragon Fetus Transformation

In ancient times, there was a country called Wuqiguo beyond the overseas boundary, whose people had no descendants. Beyond Wuqiguo, there was a mountain called Zhongshan, and the god of Zhongshan was named Zhuyin. It had a human face and a serpent body, stretching for a thousand miles and covered in deep red. When it opened its eyes, it was daytime; when it closed its eyes, it was nighttime. Its breath could turn into wind; a single exhale would bring winter to the world, while a single inhale would bring summer. It neither drank nor ate, residing east of Wuqiguo. At that time, there was a strange person at the foot of Zhongshan named Fuchang Juehe. Fuchang Juehe was transformed from Pangu's internal organs; he could eat metal and stone, especially fond of eating snakes. He was born with six arms and three heads and grew to a height of three thousand zhang in three years. When he saw a dragon, he mistook it for a big snake and swallowed it whole, eating a total of one hundred divine dragons from the heavens. \n\nWhen Zhuyin saw Fuchang Juehe, it realized that Fuchang Juehe wanted to eat it, so it turned to flee but was bitten by Fuchang Juehe, who severed its tail. Zhuyin fainted from the pain, and Fuchang Juehe gleefully grabbed the injured end of Zhuyin's tail and tried to drag it into his arms. However, Zhuyin's body was a thousand miles long, if not more, and even after ten years, Fuchang Juehe still had not found Zhuyin's head and eventually starved to death at the foot of Zhongshan. \n\nLater, a divine being named Wei Qi passed by Fuchang Juehe and saw him rise again, only to hear him express his hunger. Wei Qi fed Fuchang Juehe with food from his own body, but afterwards, Fuchang Juehe began to weep again. Wei Qi then said to him: "If you are still hungry, then eat me." After hearing this, Fuchang Juehe indeed put Wei Qi in his mouth and swallowed him, after which he fell down and died again. \n\nSeventy years later, lightning struck Fuchang Juehe's belly, and surprisingly, Wei Qi was not dead; he found Zhuyin's severed tail within Fuchang Juehe's belly. To his astonishment, the severed tail had turned into iron and stone, gathering the power of a hundred dragons,凝成 an unparalleled weapon。


Dust-melting jade

“The 'Jianmu' grows by the Weak Water River in the southeastern part of the divine land, resembling a cow and being thousands of times larger. Its leaves are like a net, and its fruits are very similar to those of the Yemu. The Jianmu was planted by the Heavenly Emperor using the divine soil known as 'Xirang,' serving as a ladder to the heavens. Whether mortals or deities, if they wish to enter the heavenly realm, they can only ascend from this tree. \n\nThere was a divine being named Yixiang, who had little magical power but was skilled in nurturing jade. One day, Yixiang went east for leisure, and a young man saw a blue-green hue appear in the sky, realizing that Yixiang would pass by his door. He placed a huge white jade stone in the road, hoping to stop Yixiang with this precious rarity and seek the method of nurturing jade. \n\nSure enough, when Yixiang arrived, he stopped moving forward. Seeing the young man, he said: 'This jade is good; unfortunately, it is dead jade. You can nurture it with blood. If you travel another ten thousand miles to bury it deep under that Jianmu for ten years, you must water it with blood, and there may still be a glimmer of hope.' After saying this, Yixiang left, and the young man took it to heart, truly following his advice. \n\nAfter enduring hardships for eight years, he finally brought the huge white jade stone to the Jianmu and followed Yixiang's instructions to drop blood into the soil every day for ten years beneath the Jianmu. \n\nAfter ten years, the young man excavated the piece of white jade, only to find that the jade had developed a bloodline, calling it living jade. Its shape had also changed, resembling a sword, appearing and vanishing unpredictably, and gaining wisdom, possessing extraordinary divine power. \n\nAt this moment, Yixiang suddenly came from beyond the heavens, singing joyfully: 'The jade lives, the jade lives, melting the Xirang to form a soul. The jade lives, the jade lives, like a child seeing a person for the first time. The jade lives, the jade lives, shy to meet the gaze of others and often hidden。


Eight arms and eight toes

Chiyou was exceptionally brave. He had eighty-one brothers, all with bronze heads and iron foreheads, sharp horns on their heads, and sword-like hair on their ears. They fed on sand and stone, gold and iron, were skilled at making various sharp weapons, and possessed immense divine power.\\nA great battle broke out between the Yellow Emperor and Chiyou. Chiyou summoned his brothers, southern tribes, and the strange gods of the mountains, forests, and waters to attack the Yellow Emperor's location in Zhuolu. The Yellow Emperor mobilized various beasts and tribes from the Central Plains to confront them. The battle was extraordinarily fierce; Chiyou was unpredictable, calling forth winds and rains, spewing smoke and mist, trapping the Yellow Emperor's army in dense fog. It was not until the Yellow Emperor's minister, Feng Hou, created a guiding cart that the Yellow Emperor's army was able to break free from the fog's encirclement. The Yellow Emperor summoned Ying Long, hoping to drown his enemies with heavy rain. Chiyou also called upon the Wind Lord and Rain Master, unleashing a more violent storm that caused the Yellow Emperor's army to scatter and flee. The Yellow Emperor then sent his daughter, Ba, to join the battle, and the torrential rain disappeared in an instant, allowing Ying Long and others to attack, frustrating Chiyou. The Yellow Emperor also made a large drum from the skin of the divine beast Kui, using the bones of the Thunder God as drumsticks. The drumbeat was deafening, heard even five hundred miles away, leaving Chiyou's army demoralized. The Yellow Emperor then laid out a variable formation, surrounding Chiyou's army multiple times until Chiyou was finally defeated and captured.\\nChiyou was killed in Zhuolu, and the shackles on his hands and feet were cast away, transforming into a brightly red maple forest, stained with Chiyou's blood.\\n。


Fang Tian's decree

Huang Gu Bo is a descendant of Ying Long. In the early ancient period of the Three Sovereigns, Ying Long was a minister of the Yellow Emperor. When Chi You fought against the Yellow Emperor, the Yellow Emperor ordered Ying Long to gather water in the fields of Jizhou to attack Chi You. However, Chi You summoned the Wind and Rain Masters to raise wind and rain, preventing Ying Long from gathering water. Thus, the Yellow Emperor sent down a heavenly maiden named Ba to assist. Upon arriving, her drought aura dissipated the rain, and Ying Long ultimately killed Chi You. \n\nIt is said that after Ying Long killed Chi You, he also killed Kua Fu, which resulted in him being unable to return to the heavenly palace and he subsequently went to reside in the south. Thus, the south became abundant in rainfall, and similarly, Huang Gu Bo was also unable to return to heaven. \n\nHuang Gu Bo was born with a fondness for rain, especially for spreading rainbows. At that time, there was a Taoist priest in the south named Shu Fang, who was skilled in gathering clouds and spreading rainbows, possessing unparalleled magical powers. Huang Gu Bo transformed into a beautiful woman and went to spy on Shu Fang’s abilities, but unexpectedly, he was recognized by Shu Fang at a glance. Seeing that Huang Gu Bo had a sincere heart, Shu Fang did not reprimand him but instead imparted genuine words, saying: “A rainbow is the light mist of the clouds. The clouds are drawn by the sun and moon; the solar rainbow shines brilliantly, dazzling with golden hues; the lunar rainbow is full, resembling abundant jade. These two are merely ordinary rainbows, but the cloud that is drawn by both the sun and moon is the heavenly rainbow, a spectral marvel.” \n\nHuang Gu Bo listened, his heart stirred with intrigue, but the laws of day and night were already determined by heaven. How could the sun and moon hide and reveal together, and how could they draw their lights to transform into a rainbow? Huang Gu Bo contemplated a method. After leaving Shu Fang, he boldly sneaked into the heavenly palace, risking great danger. First, he borrowed the sun from the Sun Mother Xi He and then asked for the moon from the Moon Mother Chang Xi. Unfortunately, he was unsuccessful and was caught by the Heavenly Emperor, who punished him severely by beheading him. \n\nWho would have thought that although Huang Gu Bo lost his head, his spirit did not die. After returning to the mortal realm, he lay by the coast of the East Sea, filled with grief and resentment. Seeing Huang Gu Bo’s persistence, Shu Fang felt pity and, knowing he had leaked heavenly secrets, took out an ancient bronze talisman in the shape of a sword, performing supreme magical powers, summoning the sun and moon to coexist. The East Sea surged to great heights, creating a mist, and within the mist, a nine-colored long rainbow emerged, its beauty enchanting and intoxicating. \n\nThis nine-colored aura was unpredictable and ever-changing, wielding ghostly powers and dyeing the sunlight and moonlight, stirring heaven and earth, incomparable to anything else. Huang Gu Bo used his heart as eyes, watching in delight, and when the rainbow light faded, he finally died of a broken heart and transformed into a pile of rocks. Subsequent generations referred to it as Wang Xia (Gazing at the Clouds). It is said that when the sea's clouds form, eyes will appear on the rocks, gazing into the clouds. \n\nAs for Shu Fang, he also faced heavenly punishment for using forbidden methods, being transformed into the bronze talisman。
