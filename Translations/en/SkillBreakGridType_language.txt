Start
Starting point of breakthrough。
End
The endpoint of the breakthrough.\\nThe breakthrough can only succeed when this cell is connected. Otherwise, no breakthrough rewards can be obtained.\\n。
General Outline

As usual
Step-by-step breakthrough。
Heritage
When connecting this cell, the connection success rate of all surrounding cells is increased by <color=#brightblue>30%</color>.\\n>。
Concealed Sea
For every successfully connected grid around this grid, the connection <color=#brightblue>success rate increases by 30%</color>。
Few gatherings
For each adjacent grid with a connection failure, the connection <color=#brightblue>success rate increases by 60%</color>。
Break and establish
The connection rate of this tile <color=#brightred>decreases by 100%</color>.\\nThe connection rate of all tiles around this tile <color=#brightblue>increases by 60%</color>.\\n>。
Incessantly
The next cell connected to this cell <color=#brightblue>can definitely connect successfully</color>。
Inspiration
Connecting this cell <color=#brightblue>will not increase the breakthrough count</color>.\\n>。
Forget myself
The connection of this square <color=#brightred>reduces the success rate by 30%</color>.\\nConnecting to this square can <color=#brightblue>reduce the number of breakthroughs by 1</color>.\\n>。
Against the flow
The connection to this grid <color=#brightred>reduces the success rate by 60%</color>.\\nConnecting to this grid can <color=#brightblue>reduce the number of breakthrough attempts by 2</color>.\\n>。
Step by step
The connection success rate of this grid has increased by 60%.\\nConnecting to this grid will additionally <color=#brightred>increase the breakthrough count by 1</color>.\\n>。
hard work
The connection to this slot <color=#brightblue>increases the success rate by 100%</color>.\\nConnecting to this slot will additionally <color=#brightred>increase the number of breakthrough attempts by 2</color>.\\n>。
Transparent
When connecting this cell, <color=#brightblue>reveals multiple undisplayed cells</color>。
Strange Calamity
The connection success rate of this cell is reduced by 60%.\\nWhen connecting to this cell, multiple cells that have failed to connect will be <color=#brightblue>restored to a connectable state</color>.\\n>。
Return of the Heart
The connection success rate of this cell <color=#brightred>decreases by 30%</color>.\\nWhen connecting to this cell, all 'special breakthrough cells' around it change to 'normal”。
Wedding dress
When connecting this cell, randomly transfer one unconnected 'Bonus Breakthrough Cell' to the surrounding 'Normal' cells that can be connected。
Nirvana
Connecting this cell can <color=#brightblue>reduce the number of breakthroughs by 3 times</color>.\\nRandomly <color=#brightred>change 1 unconnected 'Bonus Breakthrough Cell' to 'Normal'</color>.\\n>。
Burning heart
The more the number of breakthroughs exceeds half of the talent limit, the higher the <color=#brightblue>success rate of connections for this grid and all surrounding grids</color> will increase>。
Lofty aspirations
The fewer the number of breakthroughs is below half of the talent limit, the higher the connection success rate of this grid and all surrounding grids will be>。
Tip
Connecting this grid will additionally <color=#brightred>increase the breakthrough count by 1 time</color>.\\nWhen connecting this grid, immediately <color=#brightblue>consider 1 unconnected 'bonus breakthrough grid' as connected</color>.\\n>。
Complete
Already familiar with the essentials of this pattern.\\nThis pattern will definitely <color=#brightblue>connect successfully</color>.\\n>。
retrace a mistake
Once faced setbacks in this position.\\nThe connection success rate for this position has increased by 100%, but connecting to this position will result in a <color=#brightred>certain amount of health loss</color> regardless of success or failure.\\n>。
