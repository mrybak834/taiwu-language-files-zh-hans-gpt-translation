The Han Emperor, obsessed with beauty, yearned for a nation to be captivated, but for many years he couldn't attain it。
The Yang family has a daughter who has just grown up, raised in a secluded chamber, unknown to the world。
Naturally beautiful, hard to cast aside, once chosen by the king。
A glance back with a smile produces a hundred charms, while the beauty in the six palaces pales in comparison。
Spring's cold brings a bath at the Huaqing Pool, the hot spring water smooths and washes the delicate skin。
The maid helps the delicate one to rise, for it is the time when new favors are bestowed。
Cloud-like hair and blooming flower face, golden hairpin sways; the hibiscus tent warms the spring night。
The spring night is short and the sun rises high; from now on, the emperor no longer attends morning court。
Serving at the feast with no time to spare, spring travels in spring while night dedicates to the night。
In the imperial harem, there are three thousand beauties, all of whom are cherished by one person。
In the golden chamber, beautifully adorned, she serves at night; after the banquet in the jade tower, they are intoxicated with spring。
Sisters and brothers are all given land, pity the glory born at the door。
Thus, it makes parents across the world value sons over daughters。
The high palace of Li ascends into the blue clouds,仙乐风飘处处闻。
Slow songs and leisurely dances linger with the silk and bamboo; all day long, the king feels it is not enough。
The drums of Yuyang sound across the land, shattering the melody of the feathered garments。
Nine-tiered city walls rise with smoke and dust, thousands of chariots and horses head southwest。
Cuihua sways and then stops, a hundred miles west out of the capital。
The six armies cannot be deployed; alas, I died before the horse with my delicate brows。
Flower ornaments lie on the ground, unattended; green hairpins and golden sparrows adorn the hair。
The king covers his face and cannot be saved; looking back, tears of blood flow in harmony。
The yellow dust is scattered, and the wind is bleak; the clouds curl around as one ascends the Sword Pavilion。
Few people walk beneath Mount Emei, the banners lack luster under the dim sunlight。
The waters of the Shu River are blue, the Shu mountains are green, the holy lord's feelings are constant from morning to night。
The palace sees the moon and feels sorrow, while the night rain hears the bell and feels a heartbroken sound。
The heavens spin and the earth turns as the dragon rides; here I hesitate and cannot leave。
Under the soil of Mawaigpo, the beautiful face is unseen, dying in vain。
Both lord and subject look at each other with tears on their clothes, gazing eastward towards the capital as they ride home on their horses。
The gardens upon returning are still the same, the lotus of Taiye and the willows of Weiyang。
The lotus resembles a face, the willows like brows; how can one not shed tears in response to this。
On the day the peach and plum flowers bloom in the spring breeze, and when the leaves of the wutong fall in the autumn rain。
In the Western Palace and Southern Inner Court, there are many autumn grasses; fallen leaves cover the steps, red and unswept。
The disciples of the pear garden have white hair, while the green-haired supervisor of the pepper house has grown old。
The fireflies fly in the evening palace, thoughts silently arise; the lonely lamp flickers, yet sleep has not come。
The late bell tolls as the night begins, the bright Milky Way longs for dawn。
The mandarin ducks' tiles are cold with heavy frost, who shares the jade quilt's chill。
Years have passed since life and death parted, yet the soul has never entered my dreams。
Renowned Daoist from Linqiong, the guest from Hongdu, can summon souls with sincerity。
In order to express the king's longing, I therefore instruct the alchemists to earnestly seek。
Emptying the air and riding the energy, rushing like lightning, ascending to the heavens and entering the earth, seeking it everywhere。
Up to the azure skies and down to the yellow springs, both places are vast and unseen。
Suddenly heard there is a fairy mountain on the sea, the mountain is in the ethereal and misty distance。
The pavilion is exquisite, rising amidst the five clouds, where many fairies are elegantly present。
There is a person inside with a name too genuine, their snow-like skin and flower-like appearance are a mix。
At the golden palace in the west wing, I knock on the jade door, and ask little Yu to report the completion of our unity。
When I heard about the envoy of the Han family, my soul was startled in a dream within the Jiuhua tent。
Grasping the clothes and pushing the pillow, I rise and wander; the beaded curtains and silver screens open languidly。
Half-awake with cloud-like hair, she comes down from the hall with her flower crown disheveled。
The wind blows, and the immortal garments flutter and rise,似乎 like a dance of the rainbow dress and feathered clothes。
Jade beauty in loneliness, tears on the railing, a branch of pear blossoms brings spring rain。
With affection and eyes fixed, I thank Your Majesty, a farewell leaves sound and appearance both distant and vague。
In the Zhaoyang Hall, love is eternal; in the Penglai Palace, the sun and moon last forever。
Looking back down at the human world, I see not Chang'an but dust and mist。
Only the old items express deep feelings, the golden hairpin will be sent away。
A hairpin keeps one strand together, the hairpin splits golden hairpins。
But if the heart is as hard as gold, those in heaven and on earth will meet。
At parting, I earnestly send these words again, in which there are oaths known only to our hearts。
On the Night of the Seventh Day of the Seventh Month at the Palace of Eternal Life, when no one is whispering at midnight。
On the heavens, I wish to be a pair of wings; on the earth, I wish to be intertwined branches。
Time and space may eventually come to an end, but this grief lasts forever without cease。
