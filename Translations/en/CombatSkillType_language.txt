internal strength
Internal force is the foundation of martial arts, while spirit and energy are the essence of strengthening the body. The methods of breathing and guiding energy resonate with heaven and earth, harmonizing with the five elements, and achieving the balance of defense and offense; thus it is called internal force, which follows the principles of mutual generation and mutual restraint, with infinite mysteries。
Body technique
Body technique is the way of leaping and shifting. A martial artist uses qi to lighten the body, changing positions to seize opportunities, capable of saving a thousand pounds at a critical moment; at its highest level, one can tread on snow without leaving a trace and cross a river with a single reed, which ordinary people find hard to match。
Ultimate skill
In the world, few are called 'absolute'; extraordinary abilities and skills are referred to as 'techniques'. Mastery of techniques often originates from the learning and insights of various schools, with countless powers and abilities; only through dedicated effort and unique understanding can one achieve great success。
Fist and palm
Fist and palm techniques are methods of close combat for martial artists, combining the strength of the entire body into punching and palm strikes. Their principles return to simplicity; they can crush the enemy with horizontal training or achieve victory through internal strength. Even without weapons, they possess great power。
Finger method
Finger techniques refer to the method of striking vital points and acupoints on the human body, either by using internal energy to manipulate the meridians or by penetrating the bones and breaking the marrow with the fingers or nails. Within a single finger, there are countless transformations; in a small space, one can determine life and death。
Leg techniques
With agile hands, but unfortunately with short reach; strong legs can strike far. However, 'lifting the leg leaves half empty, extending the leg carries seven parts of danger.' Leg techniques must rely on the right timing and force; if applied carelessly, one may be restrained by others。
Hidden weapon
Hidden within the sleeves, it strikes unexpectedly, attacking the enemy when they are unprepared, injuring people without them noticing, hence it is called a concealed weapon; the essence of this method lies in seizing opportunities, thus it is often treacherous and secretive, and is generally disliked by gentlemen。
Swordsmanship
The sword is straight yet can bend; its path balances rigidity and flexibility, its form is dignified, hence it is called the king of weapons. Its force can be swift, can be strong and brave, can be upright, and can be cunning, changing in countless ways, never reaching an end。
Swordsmanship
A single-edged weapon is called a knife, while a double-edged weapon is referred to as a sword. The knife tip, blade, and back can all confront the enemy, earning it the title of 'King of All Weapons.' The techniques of using knives are mostly fierce and swift, disregarding costs, solely aimed at injuring the enemy。
Long weapon
The long weapon is taller than a person, hence the saying 'an inch longer is an inch stronger.' The gunfire is fierce, with no return; the staff is like a long arm, sweeping across thousands of troops; before the enemy even approaches, one has already gained the advantage。
Qimen
The short club has a heavy head and a light body, suitable for combining fist techniques and hidden weapon strategies; the double daggers with sharp edges at both ends are light and swift; the talismans are obscure and difficult to comprehend, connecting with ghosts and gods—these unusual elements are collectively referred to as the 'strange gate。
Soft Soldier
A long whip seems close yet is distant; a soft brush uses gentleness to overcome rigidity. Both have unique materials, controlled with skillful strength, thus they are called soft weapons. The key lies in managing complexity with simplicity, being able to extend and retract freely, which is fundamentally different from other weapons。
Imperial Shooting
The apparatus is exquisite, with long needles and short hairs, all extremely fine, and can only be controlled with internal energy; controlling it is equivalent to controlling a shot; when perfected, the intention reaches the object, with no distance it cannot reach, as if using the arm to direct the fingers, agile and hard to defend against。
Musical instrument
“Music is a reflection of human emotions.’ In the world, there are enchanting sounds that stir the soul; the qualities of strings and bamboo instruments are different, and the seven emotions and six desires are all expressed through playing and breathing. Only those well-versed in musical theory can master it。
