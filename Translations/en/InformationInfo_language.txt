Observations from the Capital
Gyeonggi Food: lamb, head soup, large and small bones, various types of buns, etc。
The taste is delightful, truly令人垂涎……
Every place has its own local cuisine……
It's actually just some ordinary flavors, nothing special……






Beijing opera includes various forms such as drama, puppetry, novels, music and dance, sumo wrestling, and shadow play。
There are many varieties, and everything seems interesting！
Among them... it seems I have seen it, and it's quite good……
I have seen these before, ordinary people can see them all……






The custom of girls sewing, tying colorful threads, and making flower gourds on Qixi originated from the capital region。
The customs of the mortal world are truly lovely and endearing……
Customs may be clever, but it seems that it doesn't matter much where they come from……
Isn't this how everyone celebrates the Qixi Festival……






In the winter month, there is no vegetable tea, and people in Beijing need to store winter vegetables before the start of winter for use throughout the winter。
I don’t know how they collect……
The climate in Gyeonggi is cold; although this has become a common practice, it is not surprising……
In fact, the vegetable cellar has no fresh food……






The Zhu Bridge by the river looks like a flying rainbow, with willows dipping into the water, and tobacco growing along the embankment, where there are often people fishing。
The Hongqiao is like a rainbow, fishing by the street is both beautiful and interesting……
It seems the hydrology in the river is good？
I often stroll by the bridge, and don't feel anything strange……






In the Gyeonggi gardens, one can still occasionally see the royal palace's jade forest, where visitors often come to admire the stone mountains and flowing waters。
The art of garden design is truly profound, and the financial resources spent on gardens must be enormous……
The description is indeed worth a look……
Tourists have already traveled everywhere, why mention it again……






The old royal palace no longer exists; it may have collapsed, been rebuilt, or disappeared into thin air。
Time passes and circumstances change, making one sigh……
The matters in between are indescribable……
Just broken walls and ruins, the past things……






The temples in Gyeonggi often host fasting rituals while trading rare items, goods, books, and so on。
Why not go to the temple fair to take a stroll and also eat some tea snacks……
The temple's involvement in worldly affairs, I wonder if it is appropriate……
I once went to visit, which was similar to an ordinary gathering……






In the past of Gyeonggi, everywhere were the heavenly streets and imperial roads, adorned with sculpted carriages and fine horses, accompanied by the sounds of flutes and drums。
The scenery of the old days is truly yearned for……
But no one knows whether it is true or false……
I have known about this since I was young……






Experiences in Chengdu
The people of Shu have a taste for rich flavors, favoring spicy and fragrant dishes, often seasoning with sugar cane, ginger, and chili。






Bashu is rich in resources, including Xia Ying Junzhi, salt spring iron smelting, and the Qi Niu Guang Miao, among others。
The beauty of nature and the treasures of heaven make it a superior place……
Among them... I seem to have experienced it, and it's not bad……
I have seen these before, and they are nothing unique……






Bashu is full of fun, when the season arrives, the city comes alive with performances of singing and dancing, and ten miles of blooming flowers。
It seems to be different from elsewhere……
I have seen all these landscapes……






In Sichuan, there are giant pandas, as large as bears, with black and white fur. They eat bamboo and are gentle in nature; they were anciently called 'pi。
It sounds delightful; it would be wonderful to encounter one or two by chance！
Yet I do not know where I can meet……
Cats are also common, bears are also common, and pandas are actually common too……






The Ba people worship the white tiger, and sacrifices are prevalent, occasionally revealing ancient sacrificial pits with copper trees, copper figures, and more。
To actually have ancient relics is truly our good fortune……
Generations have their remnants……
Offering sacrifices to the divine beast is only natural……






Once there was Li Bing who built canals to control flooding, and the Shu region then experienced no hunger from droughts or floods, hence it was called the Land of Abundance。
Heaven, earth, and humanity in harmony; the name of the land of abundance turns out to be like this……
That person really has some skill……
We live without worry about food and clothing, which has become an ordinary life……






When Emperor Wang died, the phoenix transformed into a cuckoo, and thus the people of Shu remembered Emperor Wang when they heard the cuckoo's call。
The cuckoo cries with blood, each sound making one reflect……
The saying of the cuckoo has a touching quality……
The cuckoo has already cried everywhere, but Emperor Wang has not returned……






Yu rose in the region of Ba, and later governed the Yellow River starting from Bashu, while connecting the Four Barbarians and the Nine Provinces。
Emperor Yu the Great governed the waters, his achievements last for thousands of generations……
Thus, it is now accessible from all directions……
Yu traveled all over Huaxia, not just in Bashu……






There are unique burial customs involving hanging coffins, where coffins are placed in holes on cliff walls, resembling the burial of immortals。
The height of the cliff, I wonder if there are immortals to help……
Oh, the coffin is placed on the mountain……
In fact, the belief that immortals are buried is just a misconception……






Observations from Guizhou
Some people live under the waterfall, with livestock stored on the lower wooden framework and people living above, called 'ganlan”。

It's quite rare, I wonder how they actually live……
I have seen this scene, it is very ordinary……






In the past, the local chieftains established medical offices to study internal medication, external washes, fumigation, and poultices。

In fact, they are all about treating illnesses and saving people, just different approaches……






On Lantern Festival night, a certain group has a custom of stealing others' greens and radishes, and those who are stolen from are not angry, but rather happy。
How could there be such actions? What is the reason behind it……
There may be some reason for this……
We consider it a blessing, which is not surprising……






It is rumored that the infant is a divine flower planted by the Flower Goddess, fallen to the mortal realm, and must worship the Flower Goddess after birth。
Perhaps everyone has a connection with the divine flower, which is indeed very sentimental……
If a person is a flower, will that flower also be reincarnated as a person？
Yes, it has always been like this……






In the past, singing and dancing were held to worship the gods; now they are a form of entertainment for the public, with song fairs taking place in spring or autumn。

Offering sacrifices to the gods and entertaining people, all are for people……
People celebrate, and nature is the blessing of the gods……






The unique grinding autumn in Guagnan features wooden beams with people rising and falling, rotating at both ends, which is quite marvelous。
Listening to that form, is it not like a celestial being dancing？
It is difficult for ordinary people to achieve……
Festivals can often be seen, nothing surprising……






Seeing the young boy dressed up as an official, everyone danced comically while lifting him forward。
Can outsiders participate? I also want to take a look……
Should it be a festive celebration? How did the little official choose it？
Oh, funny appearances, indeed often exist……






There is a qin (a traditional Chinese musical instrument) with one string, which is a wonder of the world. It is made of spotted bamboo, carved with the head of a snake, and the string is tied at the top。
One string alone cannot make a tune; with this solo string instrument, perhaps the world will change its view……
The techniques of manufacturing may also be very different……
There is indeed such a thing, but it is not as remarkable as that……






Although Guangnan is hot, it has cold mountains, with peaks piercing the clouds like five phoenixes, where celestial beings have transformed。
In the hot land and cold mountains, perhaps it is also a place where immortals reside……
If one seeks this mountain, perhaps they can also attain immortality？
There is no direction, it is indeed a mistaken transmission……

If capable people encounter it, they should be punished……
In today's world, there are indeed more thieves……






The terrain of Jingbei Mountain is steep and rugged, and the locals build beams and boards to create paths, making it possible to traverse the mountain。

In a certain place, there is still the sound of shamanism, and it is said that shamans can communicate with gods through this sound or can heal。
What sound does the witch make? Wah wah woah……

Ancient bells, it was not unusual to be buried with them……

I have heard about it for a long time, yet no one has found it……






Experiences in Taiyuan
Real estate, millet, glutinous rice, and wheat all have large ears; among them, wheat has thin skin and is mostly white, making it pleasant to eat。
The climate here can produce such goods, perhaps due to the soil and water？
It seems to taste better than elsewhere……






The people here have simple customs, shameful of lust and theft, with few disputes; they live by farming and weaving, helping each other in marriage and funerals。
If everyone helps each other, it truly is a land of happiness……
It is indeed simple and honest; there must be a deep source behind it……
Common people are often like this, yet not all are like this……






The land in Hedong is flat and fertile, rich in salt and iron, and during the Han dynasty, it produced copper and iron for the whole country。

Such splendor no longer exists today……






There are places where the stone is thick and the soil is thin and barren, where numerous Buddha statues in cliffside caves are found, carved since the Wei dynasty。

There are many such heroes in the rivers and lakes……






Customs dictate that officials do not ride horses into the streets, and marriage is considered shameful if it involves discussing money, reflecting an ancient style。

It was meant to be this way……






Common people worship gods and believe in shamans; if there is any injustice, they must ask the gods, and they often hold temple sacrifices and festivals。

It's indeed very lively, but all of it is quite ordinary……






In Shanxi, cremation was once practiced, but a prefect inscribed a decree to prohibit it, and thus burning corpses became a disgrace。

I see now……
Indeed……






There are vegetables planted on the back mountain of Shaolin Temple, including cabbage, pumpkin, and sweet potato。
These vegetables sound very delicious. If there is a chance, one could try the Shaolin vegetarian cuisine……

These are all common vegetables……






The place where Shaolin disciples meditate and comprehend the Dao is called the Zen court. The area is abundantly planted with pear trees。

Emei Sect's observations
The Golden Summit stands on Emei Mountain, and at sunset, the Golden Summit is illuminated by the Buddha's light。

I don't know what it looks like……
So it is named the Golden Summit……






The Thousand Buddha Monastery stands on Emei Mountain, with a thousand Buddha statues enshrined inside the hall and murals of the Buddha stretching for a thousand meters。
There are so many Buddha statues... yet I have never heard of them elsewhere……
So much……
It is indeed as you said……






There is a large bell in Emei, standing as high as a person, weighing twenty-five thousand pounds, and its sound can reach a thousand miles。

I do not know if I have ever heard……

This stone is naturally different from other Taihu stones……






Emei Golden Summit's She Shen Cliff, overlooking the abyss below, where people ascend, thus sacrificing themselves at the cliff。

It should be sealed off……

Observations from the Valley of a Hundred Flowers
At the entrance of Hundred Flowers Valley, there are two rocks flanking the shore, with a small gap that allows one person to pass sideways。

One does not know who discovered this paradise on earth……
That's right, it is so……






Baihua Valley builds stilt houses, concealed among the grass and trees in a village, where from a distance one sees only grass and trees, not the houses。
Being with grass and trees is indeed magical……
Living there might be very comfortable……
Then... it won't damage the forest……

There are indeed Pumi people and black gibbons in the valley; what's so unusual about that？






On the third day of the third month, the disciples of Baihua Valley decorate a deer with flowers, known as sending the Flower God。
Decorating a deer with a hundred flowers... is quite interesting……
I wonder if that deer can be obedient……
Since the Flower God has left, it is natural to send……






In the Valley of Hundred Flowers, there is a washing deer spring, whose water is clear, cool in summer and warm in winter。
Is there really such spring water in the world? It is neither hot spring nor spring……
It's quite miraculous……
Perhaps it is due to the geographical advantage...so it is cool in summer and warm in winter……






In the valley of Hundred Flowers stands a monument, inscribed with 'Deer Platform,' where Sun Simiao encountered the white deer while gathering herbs。

Indeed it is……

It was originally a funeral song……
Well... that's how it is……

I naturally know this……






Since the Qin Dynasty, many sages have secluded themselves in the rear mountains of Wudang, and it is said that there are those who have attained enlightenment。

The back mountain of Wudang may be tranquil and peaceful……
There is indeed such talk within the door, not a secret matter……






Wudang Mountain is home to the plumb tree. It is said that through true martial cultivation, one can achieve success, as the plum blossoms when inserted into the plumb tree。

Tianzhu Peak is located among the seventy-two peaks of Wudang, with sacred birds fluttering around it。

The birds are just wandering... it's nothing extraordinary……






Under the Southern Cliff of Wudang, carving stone into a dragon's head, placing incense burners in front, with sincere intent, one can arrive。

People often slip up... and lose their lives……

Oh... so magical……
Mountain rocks are like this, and there is nothing unusual about it……






Wudang Secret Realm, with stones made of gold and silver colors, because it is rarely visited by people, the spiritual objects are able to reside here。
I don’t know what spiritual objects there might be?\\nNo matter what spiritual object it is, it surely does not exist in the human world……
Perhaps there are many珍奇 that cannot be seen……
Well, it is indeed so……






At Wudang Mountain, the stone path is straight, and when travelers arrive here, all worries vanish, hence it is called the Immortal Pass。

Is it really so……
Standing on the peak in the breeze, all worries naturally dissipate……






Insights of the Won Mountain Sect
Dayuan Mountain stands tall and perilous, difficult to climb, in contrast to Xiaoyuan Mountain, which is slightly lower。
Since the peaks are perilous and difficult to climb, why not leave instead……
Is it difficult to climb? Then how do the disciples of Yuanshan come and go……
Climbing every day makes it easier to climb……






Xiaoyuan Mountain has a lot of gravel, making it difficult to traverse. It is slightly lower compared to Dayuan Mountain。
Since the gravel obstructs the path, making it difficult to come and go, why not leave instead……
The disciples of Wonsan are indeed enduring hardships……
One should strengthen the muscles and bones, and train the body……






At Big and Small Yuanshan, there are stone houses. The inhabitants face the summer heat and winter cold, and it is the residence of the disciples of Yuanshan。
If you were to let me live there, I certainly would not want to……
I have not heard of such a dwelling before……
Living in it can strengthen one's will……






At the top of Daxia Yuanshan, there are two stones that split in the middle, one is called the Sword Testing Stone, and the other is called the Knife Testing Stone。
Their swords are so sharp? They can actually cut stone……
Truly a divine weapon……
This is not the result of just a sword and a knife……






Xiaoyuan Mountain places a stone Buddha, carved from stubborn rock; Dayuan Mountain places a mud path, formed by mixing mud。
The stubborn stone might be jade... in the muddy clay, there might be gold and silver……
With sincerity... why bother about the stones and mud……
The stone Buddha is also Buddha, the muddy path is also the path……






On the larger Yuanshan and smaller Yuanshan, there are monument stones inscribed with the names of the commanders who died resisting the central authorities。
Quickly tell me who the characters are……
We should go pay our respects……
Should strive to eliminate the pivot, leaving no effort spared……






Xiaoyuanshan often has small birds that fly and perch on the roofs singing. People translate their sounds as 'Buddha appears, Buddha appears。
What kind of little bird is that? Could it be a messenger of the Buddha……
Who knows the language of birds……
I have heard this rumor before……






Between the large and small Yuanshan, in the eastern part, there is a stone staircase descending from the clouds, commonly known as the Lower Realm Stone。
This stone connects to the heavenly palace？！
Since it can descend to the lower realm, it can naturally ascend to the higher realm……
Indeed, there is such a scene... but no immortal is seen……






The stone at Dayuanshan is shaped like a hand and is called the Heart-testing Stone; if one's heart is not pure, it will not stand firm。
What is the reason for this? Can this stone really see through……
If I... could I still stand firm……
There is indeed this stone in the mountain, which can test a person's heart……






Experiences and Observations of the Lion's Gate
The beams of the Lion Xiang Gate are three or four zhang in diameter, black as iron, and cannot be damaged even when struck by giant stones。
Where did this wood come from? It's incredibly sturdy！
This wood is indeed solid……
Well, it is the wood produced in Guangzhou……






The Sleeping Lion Hall houses a golden lion statue, majestic and solemn. The disciples all face the lion statue to practice their skills。
It sounds very interesting... Is there any reason behind this？
It's not surprising to practice in front of the lion statue……






The three halls of the Lion Xiang Gate are built around the schoolyard. The schoolyard raises the lion banner, and the gatekeepers shout and fight fiercely。
It sounds very impressive! It would be great to experience it in person！
If there is a chance, I would like to see the Lion and Elephant Gate in person……
Fighting is just like this... what's so rare about it……






The Jinsitang occupies a vast area, with intricately carved beams and painted rafters, attracting many visitors from all over the world to pay their respects to the gatekeeper。
People from all corners of the world gather together... It is truly a rare sight……
The Lion's Gate is renowned... I've heard about it for a long time……
Well, it is as you said……






The doorkeeper of the Lion's Gate captures the wealthy and calls them 'Agarwood', buying agarwood in anticipation of redemption, which is called 'selecting incense。
Robbery has so many explanations... it's truly eye-opening……
It turns out there is such a saying……
Um... it seems so……






The Lion General's gate has a red-haired ship arriving, gifting a young boy with white skin, his face and limbs as pure as jade and snow。
There exists in the world someone as white as snow... Could it be a monster？
I have never seen...\\n……
That would be the foreign tribes from another world……






In Lianhua Mountain, there are silver star stones and gold star stones, which can be crushed into powder and taken with water to calm the mind。
Such effects are truly remarkable... If I have the chance, I will definitely give it a try……
Is it really so? Maybe it can be tried……
The disciples have long used this stone, which is not surprising……






Every night, there are lions and tigers patrolling the Lion's Gate, often feeding on living humans。
This... the Lion Avatar Gate can actually make lions and tigers serve its purpose……
Then you need to be careful……
The breeding of lions and tigers in the house is not a secret……






The Lion Hall stands among the three halls, where golden-haired lions are raised as tribute from the Western Regions。
The power of the Lion's Gate has reached such heights... No wonder everyone is aware of the Lion's Gate……

The golden-haired lion is unparalleled and noble, difficult for ordinary people to see……






Observations of the Ranshan Sect
On the mountain's peak, there is a Taoist temple where the immortal masters often observe the stars and the moon to seek enlightenment。
Daoist temple in the sky or an immortal palace, observing the stars and moon or divine beings……
Stargazing and moonwatching... perhaps it can truly grasp the principles of heaven……
The changes of the stars and the moon have their own reasoning……






Among the cliffs and steep walls of the mountain, many poria and huangjing grow。
So many precious medicinal herbs are unexpectedly found in the mountains！
These are all precious medicinal materials……
It is due to geographical advantages……






However, the mountain is green and the cliffs are perilous and there is no road; only immortals can reach it. On the cliff stands the Qinglang Pavilion。
Since mortals cannot reach it, how was the Qinglang Pavilion built? Is it possible that there are really immortals……
Perhaps Qinglang Pavilion was truly built by immortals……
Indeed, it is extremely dangerous……






Some disciples of Ranshan do not eat grains, but consume atractylodes and drink water。
Not eating grains! How is this possible? Will one not die...\\n……
How can this be endured...\\n……
I also know this method……






At the mountain gate, there is a plum forest where the plums bloom all year round; when one enters it, they cannot tell the directions。
I have never heard of this... Is this the mystic art of Qi Men Dun Jia that is rumored……
Truly miraculous……
It is indeed the maze set by Ranshan……






To the west of the mountain, there is a cave where the divine dragon resides. When it hears human voices, there will be wind and rain, so there is no road to the west。
By listening to the voices, one can summon the wind and rain, how extraordinary it is！
It was for this reason……
I have heard this rumor long ago; it is not a secret……






It is rumored that there is a mystical stone on the mountain; any mortal who has a question or desire can have their wishes fulfilled。
How is this possible... Could it be that Ranshan is truly a mountain of immortals？
I don't know which deity this is asking about……
Ran Mountain, Ran Mountain, answers to all questions, hence the name 'Ran”……






To the east of the mountain there is a cliff where immortals appear and disappear, some donning straw cloaks, others with strange appearances。
Yet the mountain is indeed a fairy mountain, otherwise how could there be so many deities……
I have never seen a deity……
I have also heard this rumor... but I have not seen it……






It is said that Master Guigu lived for over a hundred years, and later generations do not know his whereabouts; in fact, he is hidden in the Ran Mountain。
Is there really a secret technique to become an immortal in this world... known only by Master Guigu...\\n……
If that's the case, it would be quite strange……
Don't believe all the rumors……






Observations of the Xuan Female Sect
Xuan Nv Peak accumulates cold ice for years, still flying snow in summer, rarely experiencing hot weather, very cool。
There are still such places in the world... I was unaware before……
Perhaps we can go to a summer retreat……
Well, indeed as you said……






It is said that a celestial maiden once descended upon the peak, and thus the people of that time called this peak Yuner Peak。
Who knows which heavenly maiden it is... is it Yao Ji... or the Queen Mother of the West……
Indeed, it is for this reason……






The jade steps in Xuannv Peak are winding and formed from blue stones; when walked upon, they sound like shattered jade, hence the name Jade Steps。
The sound of pearls and jades falling to the ground must be very pleasant to hear……
It is no wonder this is the residence of a fairy……
The stone is hollow, and there is water accumulated inside, so it is like this... it is not surprising……






In the Xuan Nv Peak, there are birds dwelling; when one person claps, one bird sings first, and the following birds harmonize。
This is quite an interesting matter, that bird might be a divine bird……
So amazing, if there is a chance, perhaps it can be tried……
This bird has such habits……






At the place where the snowmelt flows down from Xuan Nv Peak, its light is like a mirror, reflecting people's brows and eyes, beautiful like an immortal。
Is it clearer than a bronze mirror? This water might be heavenly water……
Thus... I do not know who that person in the water really is……






The Tianyin Pavilion is backed by the Jade Girl Peak, and the sound of the zither echoes within, never ceasing。
What is the reason for this? Could it be that the music in the palace is truly celestial music from the heavens……
Unexpectedly so mystical……
There are reasons for it……






Inside the Xuan Nv Peak stone cave, water drips and forms a spring, known as Yaochi Water, which can quench the thirst of a thousand people in a day。
There are actually so many springs... Perhaps this really is the Jade Pool of the Queen Mother of the West……
It's a Jade Pool, so it's not surprising……
If a thousand people drink for a thousand days... they will eventually dry up……






It is said that when the goddess ascended to heaven, she transformed the heavenly ladder. The cold water from Xuannv Peak flows down from the heavenly ladder。
If it weren't for the celestial palace... how could there be such a miraculous scene……
If there is a chance, I will go and take a look……
It is indeed said so……






There was a lady residing on the Xuan Nv Peak, whose琴playing could be heard for several miles, and the birds lingered without leaving。
The sound of the zither must be the music of immortals, as it attracts a hundred birds... Unfortunately, I am destined to be unable to experience it……
Unfortunately, I have no chance to hear it……
This legend has existed since ancient times……






Observations from the Sword Forging Villa
Behind the Sword Forging Villa, the area is tranquil with lush trees, rich in mineral resources, and the spring water is crystal clear。
No wonder the weapons forged by Fei Zhu Jian Mountain Villa are incredibly sharp！
Oh... Today I just learned……






On Zhanlu Mountain, a stele was erected during the Tang Dynasty to commemorate Zhanlu, but later it was broken by wind and rain, thus it was named the Broken Stele。
It's truly a pity... what is recorded on it will thus disappear, perhaps it carries some strange tales……
Unfortunately... unfortunately……
I also know the origin of Zhanlu……






The Casting Sword Manor consists of inner and outer ring buildings, with thousands of rooms that can accommodate ten thousand people。
The mansion is like this... Can it not be compared with the palaces...\\n……
Surprisingly vast……
The number of people in the village is large, and the village is naturally vast……






In the Zhanlu Mountain, there is a stream running through pine woods, and whenever water flows by, one can hear the sound of the flowing water like that of a qin and se。
Running water can also play the zither and blow the flute, it’s really interesting！
The sound of the qin and se must be very pleasant to hear……
Its sound is indeed pleasant to the ear……






In the foundry, a thousand furnaces are cast, the flames burn day and night without extinguishing, and the sound of hammering iron does not cease throughout the year。
I've heard that all weapons in the world come from the Swordsmith Manor, and now hearing what you say, it seems to be true……
Not surprising that they can produce thousands of weapons a day……
This statement is not false……






It is rumored that when the old man entered Zhanlu Mountain, he broke branches from the rocks to relieve stiffness in his waist and legs。
I have indeed never heard this saying, but it’s worth a try！
I don't know what the reason is……
I have also heard this said……






The Sword Casting Villa has a sword-testing platform, on which stones are placed, and below are knives, spears, swords, and halberds piled high like mountains。
No wonder the Forged Sword Villa produces divine weapons! It should be this way！
Really a pity……
However, the Sword Testing Platform does not leave the Sword Forging Manor……






There is a stone for testing swords at the Sword Casting Villa, which was split by the legendary Zhan Lu sword, left by Ou Yezi。
The Zhanlu sword is indeed extraordinary! There are few divine weapons in the world that can rival it！
The Zhanlu divine sword is indeed sharp……
The divine sword forged by Master Ouye naturally is like this……






At the Swordsmith Mountain, the immortal Ziyou Yei's pillow is placed, and many swordsmiths burn incense here to seek protection。
In the world, there really are immortal pillows! I originally thought it was just a rumor……
Since it is a thing of Ou Yezi, it must certainly have some extraordinary qualities……
Well, there is indeed a celestial pillow in the Sword Forging Villa……






Observations of the Empty Mulberry Sect
The wood from Kong Sang Mountain is as hard as iron; it makes a sound when knocked, and people often use it to make musical instruments。
The musical instruments made from such wood must be different from ordinary ones……

Empty Mulberry Mountain is surrounded by six hundred acres to create a medicinal herb garden, planting Ganoderma, snow ginseng, and snow lotus。

In the Empty Mulberry Mountain, there are countless purple and emerald alchemical rooms, often filled with blue smoke and purple mist, with the alchemical furnaces gathering clouds。

Thus, it is for the reason of the disciples in the gate refining alchemy……






The vegetation of Kong Sang Mountain is unique, with variegated and mixed colors; those as tall as cattle are rarely recognized by people。

All are rare flowers and strange grasses……
Well... this place is naturally different from elsewhere……






There is a cave in Kong Sang that extends endlessly downward, faintly glowing, rumored to be the dwelling of the White Snake。

There is indeed a saying that goes like this……






If there are those with strong desires climbing the mountain, the empty mulberry mountain will be shrouded in mist and cloud, with fierce beasts lurking by the path。

In the Diamond Hall, there stand eight octagonal pillars, enshrining the statue of the Diamond King, with secret writings on the plaques on both sides。

The Buddha hall is like this……






The Endless Vajra Sect raises a herd of elephants in the back garden, thus creating rivers of water and piling up fruits like mountains。

In the western regions, elephants can often be seen……
The elephant is a sacred object……






The Vajrayana sect has a Buddha's tooth, measuring over an inch, with a yellowish-white color and a pure gleam, displayed in the main hall for the monks。

A rare treasure indeed……

Before the Vajra Hall, there is an open area of a hundred miles, where a high platform called the Blessing Hall is set up, and a merit box is placed on top。

It should be so……






Insights of the Five Immortals Sect
The Wuxian Religion built a village, ascending from the foot of the mountain, with thousands of households connected, water flowing in front of the door。
Listening to what you said, it is a very peaceful place……
It is not the same as the architecture of the Central Plains……
It is indeed my Miao village……






The followers of the Five Immortals Sect are also people engaged in fishing, hunting, agriculture, and sericulture; when there is a call within the sect, the crowd gathers。
Do they actually farm and hunt as well? It really differs from what I thought……
So... there is nothing particularly special about it……
Indeed, as you said……






The followers of the Five Immortals Sect worship nature, and everywhere on the rocks of the mountains, one can see totem images of insects and worms。
It is truly terrifying to take insects as totems！
Indeed terrifying……
What is there to be astonished by insects... I often serve them……






The Wuxian Sect is situated by the valley, which is humid and infested with poisonous snakes, making it impossible for anyone to enter or exit。
There are indeed such frightening places in the world!\\n！
It's still better to avoid stepping into the Five Immortal Sect……
We have our own ways of defense……

The Gu Cave is a holy place……






Anyone skilled in the art of gu can transmit their poison to others by blowing it with their breath and looking at them。

Indeed hard to guard against……
There is indeed such a person in teaching……






Experiences and Observations at the Boundary of the Qingmen
On the eastern side of Jueqing Cliff, there are stone formations resembling bared teeth, and remnants of an old well and mortar still exist, which used to serve as a hiding place for bandits and thieves to evade soldiers。
In this case... it has a similar charm to the Peach Blossom Spring……
Robbers... assassins... can also be considered the same kind……
This is an old story……






On the cliff where nothing grows, rainwater accumulates in the stones, and the disciples go to the stones to fetch water。
The water in the sky, the spring in the stone, I wonder what differences there are……
There is nothing different from ordinary spring water……






The cliffs of the world are sharp and jagged, with many strange shapes, and people often lose their lives because of this。
The stone can actually kill someone; no wonder it is the place where the Boundary Green Gate is located……
If one is not careful, one will naturally lose their life……






In the cave of the boundary green cliff, there are passages everywhere, unobstructed; once a person enters, they disappear without a trace。
I see! Is it often that it disappears without a trace……
It turns out it was the cave's fault……






At the east of the cliff, sharp rocks protrude in a sequential order forming steps, rising straight up, which is referred to as 'Forgotten Life。

People walk upon it, life and death in an instant……






Jie Qingya stands with a stele: How high is the place? The stars are below. It is called the Star-Observing Cliff。
The stars are actually underfoot... Could it be that the gate to the celestial realm is already in the heavenly palace……
Surprisingly high……
Standing above it, the stars are at your feet……






At the cliff for stargazing, the stone forms a cave, where the lights inside flicker and waver, as if a ghost is lighting the lamps。
Ghosts and monsters make their homes in caves, do they know how to light a lamp? It's quite an interesting story……
Perhaps it is the light of fireflies……






At the bottom of the abyss under the cliff, there are strange beasts that feed on human corpses, and one can often hear the sound of them gnawing on bones。
What you say is so terrifying... I don't know what kind of strange beast that is……
Truly terrifying……
There may be fierce beasts below the cliff……






The name of the immortal's hand is at the bottom of the Abyss of No Birth, a place where no one can reach; ascending it may lead to an immortal response。

Not sure who can reach its summit……
It's just a rumor……

On Chiming Island, there is a spring with boiling water, its taste is pungent, and items thrown into it are cooked in an instant。
Such hot spring water is truly rare……
I don't know what the taste is like……

Chiming Island has earthen houses, separated by ravines, with molten lava circling the city as if the flow of fire is never extinguished。
Molten magma encircling the city... the flames unextinguished... I do not know what kind of scene this is……
It is indeed a spectacle……
The Fulong Altar has always been like this, so it's not particularly strange……






The magma on Chiming Island converges in a pool, flowing and churning, never solidifying, known as the Fire Pool。
I have seen mountain springs, rivers, and ice pools... but I have never heard of fire pools……
I don't know what the difference is with the hot spring……
The molten slag does not solidify, which is due to the high temperature……






At the crater of Chiming Island, there are land patterns resembling a golden dragon, which are said to be a divine phenomenon。
There are dragon patterns on the ground, perhaps it is truly a miracle！
So miraculous… perhaps it is a miracle……

Views and Insights of the Diamond Sutra
In the rivers and lakes, it is said that the Unbounded Vajra Sect sought Buddha with great dedication and eventually received the introduction of the successor of Taiwu.

Thereafter, the propagation of the esoteric Buddhist teachings led to a gradual cessation of local grievances.

When the heir of Taiwu unseals 'Fenshen Lian', he becomes like petals flying away with the wind, and the strange phenomena in this place return to normal。
Since ancient times, the character of love is hard to decipher, and such infatuation moves people……
The pain of a burning heart is truly hard to anticipate……
I have also heard of the matter regarding the clothing of the marquis……
Brave the fire and boiling water, and remove the fuel from under the cauldron

Insight and Observations of the Dragon Soul - Real
“Jie Long Po’ is paved with bones, and inside the tomb is an unusual person named Wei Qi, with unkempt hair and a dirty face, who spares no effort in pursuit of the Great Way. Wei Qi sacrificed his life to seek the Dao but ultimately fell into the demonic path. Until the successor of Tai Wu unseals ‘Jie Long Po’, seeming to comprehend something, he then dissolves into the mud, and the strange phenomenon in this place returns to normal。
To seek the truth can lead to this, which is also a piece of sincere heart……

Views and Experiences of Dust Dissolution
“Rongchenyin’ is made of jade, and inside the tomb lives a strange person named Yixiang, who has a graceful appearance and looks like a youth. He is skilled in the art of nurturing jade. However, Yixiang became possessed by the notion of perfection and ultimately fell into demonic ways, until the inheritor of Taiwu unsealed ‘Rongchenyin’, causing it to scatter into countless jade beads, and the strange phenomena in this place returned to normal。
Could it be that such flawless jade truly exists in this world……
Flawless and perfect, difficult to find in the world……
I have also heard about that matter……
Go to eliminate falsehood and reveal the truth
Illusions and reflections, the difficulty of distinguishing between reality and illusion

Observations and Experiences of the Prison Demon Tree · Reality
“The 'Prison Demon Wood' is surrounded by a maples forest in deep red, and inside the tomb lies a strange person named Blood Maple, who has sharp horns on his head and a murderous intent that remains undiminished after countless battles. Blood Maple sought to bring peace to the world but failed, ultimately descending into the path of demons, until the heir of Taiwu unsealed the 'Prison Demon Wood,' causing the maple wood to break and fall to the ground, restoring the unusual phenomena in this place back to normal。

Ghosts and Gods: Observations of Xia
“In the sky of 'Ghost God X霞,' the sun and moon are mottled, and within the tomb resides an unusual person named Shufang, who possesses magical powers and is particularly adept at gathering clouds and weaving rainbows. Shufang, troubled by the difficulty of fulfilling恩义, ultimately fell into the demonic path, until the successor of Taiwu unsealed 'Ghost God X霞,' allowing him to ride the clouds and leave, restoring the unusual phenomena of this place to normal。
The sun and moon cannot coexist, and it is also difficult to fulfill both kindness and duty……
The spectacular sight of the rainbow clouds is enchanting……
I have also heard about matters of medical prescriptions……
Defeating the strong with the weak, and human effort prevailing over nature
Hardships of old age and the end of the year, hair thinning and teeth missing

Observations from Baihua Valley: Decline
In the battle against madness, the inheritor of Taiwu was the first to find clues. Inspired by this, the people of Baihua Valley joined forces to investigate, and two grandmasters even came out of seclusion to fight the demons together. Unfortunately, perhaps due to the hopelessness of saving the world, after the matter was concluded, the two grandmasters still retreated from the world……
The difficulty of saving the world is harder than ascending to the heavens, yet there are still the disciples of Taiwu swimming against the current……
The two founders of Baihuagu must be getting old, and in the future, we will have to rely on the talents passed down from Taiwu……

In the battle against madness, the inheritor of Taiwu, along with the two ancestors of Hundred Flower Valley, jointly vanquished demons and monsters, forging a bond of friendship. Perhaps moved by Taiwu's righteous cause of saving the world, the two ancestors ventured out again……
The inheritor of Taiwu and the ancestor of Baihua Valley, one seeks to save the world, the other seeks to save people, they are indeed like-minded individuals！
The relationship between the heirs of Taiwu and the Hundred Flower Valley must have deepened further……
I am aware of this matter……
