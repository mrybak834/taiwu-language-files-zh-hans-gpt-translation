Later, wherever he went, the rebel army often fled at the sound of his approach, and the people cheered along the streets！”
“The book writes: In the second year of Zhide, the Tang army faced off against 100,000 rebel troops at Xiangji Temple.

“Although I want to make Brother Lei the master of the sect, Brother Lei is unwilling to change his surname to 'Li', saying he is the only heir of the Lei family. I may admire heroes, but the ancestral rules of the Lion Resembling clan cannot be changed lightly！”

The elders, seeing that although he was young, he had some spirit, took him under their wing. You must say, Leikun did live up to expectations; not only was he intelligent, but he also made rapid progress in martial arts. In just a few years, he mastered the clan's unique skills and frequently achieved merits, quickly rising to the rank of a disciple in the Sleeping Lion Hall……”
“Several years ago, the alien tribe frequently invaded Guangzhou. The sect leader ordered the first hall master to lead the troops in resistance, but that alien tribe was too cunning.

Originally, such a major matter should not have been entrusted to a hall disciple, but the sect leader, with his keen eye for heroes, valued them highly and truly appointed Lei Kun as the commander, allowing him to lead a total of ten thousand hall disciples to Guangzhou. Afterwards, he indeed lived up to the sect leader's high hopes, and within just a few months, he drove the alien tribe out of the waters of Guangzhou……”
“Leikun has been stationed in the waters of Guangzhou for several years. The master of the gate appreciates his hard work and achievements, so gold, silver, treasures, beautiful women, and famous steeds have always been sent to Guangzhou as rewards. However, it seems that Leikun does not care for these things, as he returns everything each time……”

The doctor who treated Master Lei said: 'If he had delayed for just a little longer, even a Celestial Being would not have been able to save him……”
“Master Lei won a great victory in battle, driving the foreign tribes beyond the waters of Guangzhou.

“The matter of the mutual pivot, I have only heard a little from the old master, but I do not know the details within……”
“It seems that the disaster of the Xiangshu is imminent...\\n We must sharpen our weapons to prepare for the unforeseen..."\\n……”
“Several disciples' weapons have been broken by that Xiangshu's minions... I didn't expect Xiangshu to be so difficult！”
“Recently, more and more people have come to the villa to purchase weapons... the world has become so unstable……”
“The Seal of the Xiangshu has been buried underground for hundreds of years, and the craftsmanship of my Sword Forging Manor has greatly improved. This battle may not be without a chance of victory……”
“Everyone says that the Exquisite Shield is invulnerable, so what should we do if we strike it with a thousand knives and ten thousand spears？”
“Right now, my forging skills haven't improved at all! I can only blame myself for not putting enough effort by the forge on usual days……”
“The Relic? It's just an old legend. The path to immortality is what truly matters！”
“The chaos in the jianghu, what of it? Our sect is hidden within the snow-capped mountains, how could the turmoil of the Central Plains possibly affect us？”
“The master has said: The way of alchemy lies in calming the mind. Those trivial matters of the world, I have never cared about……”
“Alchemy and immortality are the long-held aspirations of my sect, but now with demons rampant, I fear the road ahead will become increasingly fraught with difficulties……”
“The Rebellion of Xiangshu has now actually spread to my Kong Sang Mountain! My faction is afraid it can no longer remain aloof……”
“Does this person who has lost their mind still fear poison? Don't overthink it, just focus on refining the elixir……”
“Although the Longevity Pill has not yet been refined, with our sect's skills in poison and medicine, it may not be impossible to compete with that demon……”
“The disaster of the mutual pivot spreads across the nine provinces, if the world is to be completely lost, where else can my empty mulberry clan go……”
“I have not yet attained longevity, and the pivotal moment has arrived; could it be that my life must end here……”
“Good, good! It is indeed the Buddha's blessing, \\n this chaos in the Central Plains is a great opportunity for us to restore our fortunes……”
“With the turmoil in the rivers and lakes, refugees come to seek shelter, so naturally we must present more offerings to the Buddha……”
“Recently, people's hearts are unsettled, so we can only urge the tribute every day,\\n we cannot let the common folks neglect the Buddha……”
“With the situation having escalated to this point, we can only hold off on our plans for restoring the country……”
“Why should we fear any external forces? With the Dharma King here to protect the teachings, the common people can just worship freely！”
“Now that things are in such chaos, we should gather more wealth and show our sincerity to the Buddha……”
“Ridiculous! How could the hundreds of years of foundation of my Vajra Sect be destroyed by the hands of a mere cog？”
“I and others follow the Dharma King, and with the boundless powers of the Secret Tantra, we are not necessarily afraid of that spokesperson！”
“May the Buddha bless us; if we can avoid this calamity of the central axis, we will surely double the offerings and incense……”
“Hearing that the Central Plains are in turmoil, we all must be cautious, \n we cannot get embroiled in the conflicts of outsiders……”
“Let the outsiders fight among themselves, but anyone who dares to harm our Miao territory, I will never spare them！”
“Since entering, the master has taught me to concentrate on my cultivation and not to pay attention to the chaos of other tribes……”
“If the turmoil threatens the world, even the five immortals cannot safeguard themselves and must respond as soon as possible……”
“Hmph, if it weren't for the current power of Xiangshu, I really wouldn't want to get involved with those outsiders……”
“What's the big deal about demons causing trouble? Our Five Immortals Sect can defend ourselves, why rely on outsiders！”
“I have guarded the Five Immortals for generations; even if I die here, I cannot lose this pure land！”
“Although Xiang Shu is formidable, if he dares to invade, our Five Immortals' Gu techniques are not to be trifled with！”
“The birds and beasts have also run away, the flowers and trees have withered, and my little bugs all... sob……”
“The young man from the world observes the six paths with his eyes and hears the eight directions with his ears. Recently, I have naturally long been aware of the affairs of the world……”
“Recently, the jianghu has been turbulent, \\n While we were out executing our commission, we also heard rumors about Xiangshu……”
“The Interface Blue Gate has always only accepted commissions for killing, as for the matter of exorcising demons, they are completely unaware……”
“Monsters plague the world, killing and fighting arise everywhere; in today's world, it is indeed a good time to accept commissions……”
“Although expelling demons and guarding the way is not what we seek, we cannot allow monsters to wreak havoc on our own territory……”
“The task of escorting the mentally ill is indeed thankless and difficult; it would be better to take on some assignments for seeking committee members……”
“The Xiangshu is already an enemy to the whole world, and our realm's Qingmen cannot avoid taking on this order; we must also exchange a few moves with the Xiangshu！”
“We have entered the realm of the Qingmen, and we know that life and death depend entirely on one's own abilities, especially in chaotic times……”
“I know my skills are not yet perfected, but I am unwilling to fall like this at the feet of demons……”
“The 'Xiangshu' is a demon from hundreds of years ago; compared to the might of the True Dragon, it is simply not worth mentioning……”
“The world hears the name of evil demons and is immediately alarmed; it is all because their faith in the true dragon is not sincere enough……”
“Recently, rumors have been rampant in the martial arts world. Rather than worrying about external connections, it is better to wholeheartedly serve the true dragon……”
“Although the Fulong Altar is under the protection of the True Dragon, the Xiangshu is also not to be underestimated; one must make preparations early……”
“The Fulong Altar is protected by the true dragon, so it is naturally invincible; even if the Xiangshu descends, what is there to fear！”
“If the world truly falls into chaos one day, the true dragon will undoubtedly appear to save it！”
“At present, the true dragon's descent seems to be hopeless. With the current situation, we can only rely on the weapons in our hands and fight our way through with blood！”
“There is no other way now, we can only fight to the death...\\nI hope that the sincerity of the past can exchange for the protection of the true dragon…”\\n……”
“When will the true dragon finally arrive…\\nI am weak and powerless, not knowing if I can see that day...’\\n……”
“Recently, rumors in the jianghu have often concerned the Xiangshu, which is precisely an opportunity for the prosperity of our sect……”
“Recently, there have been many disturbances in the rivers and lakes, all attributable to the divine might of the Supreme God Xiangshu……”
“I sincerely offer my prayers, but I do not know when the great deity will arrive……”
“I teach that although it is to praise the power of the God of the Axis, could it be that the God of the Axis truly has the power to descend……”
“Now there are disciples of the Lord Xiangshu everywhere; join our sect as soon as possible to enjoy protection！”
“The great deity of the Xiangshu is becoming increasingly powerful, and us younger generations can also enjoy the good life！”
“With the connection to the outer world, I also know I cannot escape this disaster, so now I can only take a gamble……”
“Many people in the teaching have already died at the hands of the enemy...\\nDon't think that there is no one to back me, would we sit and wait for death！”
“Upon hearing that Xiang Shu has descended, the church has already been turned upside down; we will no longer be deceived……”
“I am ordered to guard the warehouse strictly, and everyone in the sect is fully supporting me. We have made sufficient preparations both inside and outside the warehouse, forming a defense line. The combined strength of everyone here can fend off strong enemies, ensuring absolute safety... Please do not engage in conversation with me, so as not to jeopardize my important duty……”
