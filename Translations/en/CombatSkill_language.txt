Jade Concubine Leads
The jade concubine evokes times when the zither and the lute harmonize, dancing in rainbow garments before the flowers; in times of falling, it is like drums beating in unison, startling a thousand strategists.

Disheartened
Waiting for someone, ah
The song 'Hou Ren Xi Yi' comes from the ancient Tu Mountain clan's daughter Jiao.

Infatuation
Perfect Woman's Heavenly Sound
“The Great Emperor sent Su Nu to play the fifty-string zither, filled with sorrow; the Emperor's prohibition could not stop it, thus the zither was broken into twenty-five strings.

Shake like a tiger
Peiran Jue
The Peiran Technique takes a different approach within the method of internal energy circulation and transformation, accumulating energy without exhaling and repeatedly refining it.

Small Leap Skill
The Little Leap Skill is a superficial light skill that involves quick actions through continuous leaps. Although the practice method is very simple, the training process is extremely long, requiring decades of hard work to master. Thus, despite the simplicity of the skill, there are very few practitioners。

Fifteen Ancient Methods
The martial arts learned by a person resurrected from death are diverse and chaotic, mostly forcibly infused into the body. Although this person had once lost all his power, he is now driven by death energy and demonic energy, causing those mysterious techniques to manifest strange abilities once more. Under the influence of death energy and demonic energy, these skills, while immensely powerful and capable of unconventional application, will reveal fatal flaws when confronted with true orthodox methods。


Great Power Heroic Spell
“Iron cavalry surrounds Dragon City, the bow's cry severs scales, tigers and lions unleash wind and thunder, might and valor reign supreme." The divine authority forged through countless battles and fierce charges, while not limited to breathing techniques and cultivation, places great emphasis on courage and state of mind, and cannot be mastered by those without extensive battlefield experience。
